### Bio
<img src="/assets/pictures/joacim_round.jpg" align="right" hspace="20">Joacim is Associate Professor (docent) and Program Director of the [Firm Competitivness](https://www.ifn.se/en/research-programs/firm-competitiveness/) program at the [Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN)](https://www.ifn.se/en/). He holds a Ph.D. from Hanken School of Economics and has been a Fulbright Scholar at New York University.

His research is focused on technological change, startups, corporate ownership and human capital. A central research question is how we can improve the competitiveness of firms and the economy at large through getting the right people to create, own, control, and work in the right firms. He also works on how to best regulate new tech. His research is detailed in over 30 publications and working papers and it has been featured in major national and international newspapers. It has over 1350 cites in [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q0dCshQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en) and ranks top decile by all-time downloads worldwide in [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=397712).

### Selected Research

Olsson, M, and J. Tåg. 2021."[What Is the Cost of Privatization for Workers?](https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3134462)" Revise and resubmit at *The Journal of Finance*. 
* The privatization of state-owned enterprises is on the agenda of policymakers across the globe. Using rich administrative data on firms and workers covering two decades, we study how privatization affects the careers and welfare of workers. Consistent with the effects of an initial reorganization of the workforce, wage income declines and unemployment increases. These effects are stronger for workers protected by state ownership. We do not find negative spillovers on family and health outcomes. We also demonstrate that privatization encourages workers to enter entrepreneurship. The firm-level productivity gains from privatization are approximately five times larger than the incumbent worker-level costs due to lost wage income.

Keloharju, M., S. Knüpfer, and J. Tåg. 2021. "[CEO Health](http://ssrn.com/abstract=3560071)" 
* We document that CEOs are in much better health than the population and on par with other high-skill professionals. We explore three channels which could account for CEOs’ robust health. First, we find health predicts appointment to a CEO position. Second, the CEO position has no discernible impact on the health of its holder. Third, poor health is associated with greater CEO turnover. These results are consistent with boards appointing CEOs with health robust enough to withstand the pressures of the job, correcting mismatches occurring at the time of appointment, and responding expediently to health shocks. Poor CEO mental health also affects corporate performance, suggesting that board oversight has enough friction for CEO health to affect performance.

Colonnelli, E., J. Tåg, M. Webb, and S. Wolter. 2018. “[A Cross-Country Comparison of Dynamics in the Large Firm Wage Premium](https://doi.org/10.1257/pandp.20181067).” *AEA Papers and Proceedings* 108 (May): 323–27.
* We provide stylized facts on the existence and dynamics over time of the large firm wage premium for Brazil, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The large firm premium exists in all these countries. However, we uncover substantial differences among them in the evolution of the wage premium over time and no evidence of common cross-country industry trends.

* We argue that ownership change is one driver of job polarization by showing that private equity buyouts of low productive firms are coupled with productivity enhancing investments in automation and offshoring. As a result, workers performing routine or offshorable job tasks in these firms tend to get laid off.

Baziki, S., PJ Norbäck, L.Persson, and J. Tåg. 2017. “[Cross-Border Acquisitions and Restructuring: Multinational Enterprises and Private Equity-Firms](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2017.02.012).” *European Economic Review* 94 (May): 166–84.
* A large share of cross-border acquisitions are undertaken by private equity firms. We propose a model with endogenous financial frictions in which multinational firms and foreign private equity firms bid for domestic assets. Stronger firm-specific synergies, lower restructuring costs, higher exit costs, better access to internal capital markets, a higher risk premium on lending, higher moral hazard problems, and higher trade costs favor multinational firms. Cross-country acquisition patterns are consistent with these predictions.

Tåg, J, T. Åstebro, and P. Thompson. 2016. “[Hierarchies and Entrepreneurship](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2016.06.007).” *European Economic Review* 89 (October): 129–47.
* We show that firms with flatter hierarchical structures spawn more entrepreneurs. We investigate two potential explanations for this distinctive hierarchy effect. Part of the effect could be to be due to preference sorting by employees, and part due to employees in firms with fewer layers having a broader range of skills (ability sorting). We show that entrepreneurhip entry increases with a worker's prior rank in an organization, which is consistent with ability sorting and inconsistent with preference sorting.
